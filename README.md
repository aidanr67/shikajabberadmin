php admin site for prosody jabber server using mySQL storage

This site is designed for a specific community jabber server. Therefore the server name (shikajabber.lan) is hard coded into all JID's. I may change this later if needed.

This site required that the prosody storage be set to "external" -> mySQL database. 
I have written code for "internal" but it gets a bit messy and using a database is just way easier.
